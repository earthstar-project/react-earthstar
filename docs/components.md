# Components

While [Earthbar](earthbar) is a good one-stop-shop for Earthstar functionality, there are many occasions when it will make more sense to embed those features within your own interfaces.

And you _could_ write those yourself, but why not use these pre-made, accessibility-ready components instead?

The screenshots below are of the components with the default layout styles and 'Junior' theme applied. To learn more about styling, see the [Styling Guide](styling.md)

## AddWorkspaceForm

![AddWorkspaceForm](images/add-workspace-form.png)

A form where you can input a workspace address and initial pub manually. Not the best for adding an existing workspace (see InvitationRedemptionForm), and not the best for creating a new one (see WorkspaceCreatorForm), but an acceptable middle-ground.

## AuthorKeypairForm

![AuthorKeypairForm](images/author-keypair-form.png)

A form where you can type in an author address and secret and use it to set the current author (if it's a valid pair).

## AuthorKeypairUpload

![AuthorKeypairUpload](images/author-keypair-upload.png)

A button you can press to summon a file chooser to upload a keypair.json. Sets the current author if valid.

## AuthorLabel

![AuthorLabel](images/author-label.png)

Given an author address (e.g. `@suzy.1abe7...`) returns a span containing the shortname (e.g. `@suzy`).

## CopyAuthorAddressButton

![CopyAuthorAddressButton](images/copy-author-address-button.png)

A button which copies the current author's address to the clipboard.

## CopyAuthorSecretButton

![CopyAuthorAddressButton](images/copy-author-address-button.png)

A button which copies the current author's secret to the clipboard.

## CurrentAuthor

![CurrentAuthor](images/current-author.png)

A label showing the current author's shortname (e.g. `@suzy`), or "Not signed in" in the case of no current author.

## CurrentWorkspaceSelect

![CurrentWorkspaceSelect](images/current-workspace-select.png)

A `<select>` element which changes the current workspace.

## DisplayNameForm

![DisplayNameForm](images/display-name-form.png)

A form which changes the display name of the current author for a workspace specified by the `workspaceAddress` prop.

## DownloadKeypairButton

![DownloadKeypairButton](images/download-keypair-button.png)

A button which triggers a download of the current author's keypair.json when clicked.

## InvitationCreatorForm

![InvitationCreatorForm](images/invitation-creator-form.png)

A form which creates an invitation code for a given workspace, provided via the `workspaceAddress` prop. The form offers an interface for selecting which pubs are embedded along with the invitation code.

## InvitationRedemptionForm

![InvitationRedemptionForm](images/invitation-redemption-form.png)

A form which takes an invitation code and adds the encoded workspace and pubs to the app. Also offers an interface for selecting which pubs you'd like to add.

## LocalStorageSettingsWriter

(Doesn't render anything!)

This component writes app settings to a browser's localStorage whenever there are changes. Use it with the `useLocalStorageEarthstarSettings` hook, which reads the values it writes.

## NewKeypairForm

![NewKeypairForm](images/new-keypair-form.png)

A form for generating a new author keypair from a four-letter input. Has an `onSuccess` prop which is a callback with a `AuthorKeypair` as its first argument.

## PubEditor

![PubEditor](images/pub-editor.png)

An interface for adding and removing pub servers for the workspace given by the `workspaceAddress` prop.

## RemoveWorkspaceButton

![RemoveWorkspaceButton](images/remove-workspace-button.png)

A button which removes the workspace given by the `workspaceAddress` prop when clicked.

## SignOutButton

![SignOutButton](images/sign-out-button.png)

A button which unsets the current author when clicked.

## SyncingCheckbox

![SyncingCheckbox](images/syncing-checkbox.png)

A checkbox which toggles whether workspaces are being synced with pub servers or not.

## WorkspaceCreatorForm

![WorkspaceCreatorForm](images/workspace-creator-form.png)

A form which helps create valid and suitably random workspace addresses. Also offers a combobox which can be used to associate known pubs from other workspaces with the new one.

## WorkspaceLabel

![WorkspaceLabel](images/workspace-label.png)

A label which takes a workspace address (e.g. `+trains.a123`) and returns an anonymised version (e.g. `+trains`)

## WorkspaceList

![WorkspaceLabel](images/workspace-list.png)

A bullet point list of all known workspaces.
